            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Society of Asian Scientists and 
                Engineers(SASE) represents those of Asian heritage in the scientific 
                and engineering communities. Our goal is to give the members the 
                resources they need to succeed in their academic and career 
                endeavors as well as being able to network with other fellow 
                scientists and engineers.</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>The nationwide mission of SASE is to prepare 
            Asian scientists and engineers for success in their careers and the 
            global business world. As well as creating diversity on campus and in 
            the workplace and providing opportunities for members to give back to 
            their communities.</p>
            <p>In addition to the national mission, the 
            SASE-UM chapter has a mission to establish an active presence of 
            Asians in engineering and science on campus and engage in the 
            community by emphasizing each individual&#39;s technical skills. 
            Furthermore, we hope to strengthen the leadership and communication skills of 
            our members to better prepare them in the business world and their 
            careers.</p>

            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>The University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded in October 2010, and has since gained support from various departments in the university. Before the SASE chapter was brought to the University of Michigan, there were many other ethnic scientific and engineering societies, but there was not any that that truly represented those of Asian heritage who were involved in science and engineering. It was on this basis that the University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded as well as the entire nationwide SASE community. The national SASE community was founded in 2007 by 10 Proctor and Gamble interns. Today the SASE community spans across many colleges nationwide.</p>
